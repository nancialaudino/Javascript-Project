# Dynamic Website Project – JavaScript

Welcome to my first dynamic website project developed in JavaScript!

This project is part of a learning journey at **Campus Numérique in the Alps**, focused on building a fully functional and interactive website **without any external plugins**.

The site is structured using modern web development practices and was built following the **AGILE methodology**.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The website includes the following three main pages:

- **Homepage (Feed)**: A dynamic feed displaying articles or posts.
- **Gallery Page**: A visual gallery with multiple display options.
- **Games Page**: A section featuring previously developed browser games.

Each component is built with vanilla JavaScript, using techniques like **AJAX (via Fetch API)** and **DOM manipulation**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Feed

- Fetch and display posts using `fetch()` on page load and refresh click.
- Dynamically generate HTML blocks for each post.
- Modular, reusable JavaScript functions for clarity and maintainability.

### 2. Dropdown Menu

- A custom-built dropdown menu, fully developed without plugins.

### 3. Dynamic Form

- A form integrated into the feed to dynamically add new posts.

### 4. Gallery Page

- A flexible gallery view with two layout options: **mosaic** or **column**.
- No plugin usage — pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 5. Image Upload

- Users can upload images to the gallery.
- Newly added images are immediately rendered on the page.

### 6. Delete Functionality

- Ability to delete user-added posts or images only (not pre-loaded ones).

### 7. Advertisement Carousel

- A simple ad banner on the gallery page displaying rotating images automatically.

### 8. Games Integration

- Incorporates browser-based games created in earlier exercises, accessible from the **Games** page.

## ⚙️ Agile Workflow

This project follows an Agile workflow to simulate a real-world development process:

- 📌 **Issues**: One GitHub issue per feature.
- 🧩 **Milestones**: Grouping related issues for each development phase.
- 📋 **Kanban Board**: Visual board to track progress in real time.

## 💡 Development Guidelines

- Experiment freely — errors are part of learning!
- Make **frequent and atomic commits** to ensure clean version history.
- Reference past resources when stuck.
- Don’t hesitate to ask instructors for help or clarification.
